Objective:
The objective of this project is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and perform text analysis to compute variables.
There are two .py files(task(1).py & task(2).py) First execute task 1, then task 2.

Data Extraction:
Input.xlsx
For each of the articles, given in the input.xlsx file, i've extracted the article text and saved the extracted article in a text file with URL_ID as its file name.
While extracting text program i've extracted only the article title and the article text.
NOTE: USED PYTHON PROGRAMMING & libraries like : BEATIFULSOUP, SELENIUM & SCRAPY for data crawling.
Out of all those files, I have attacked samples of the first two files i.e bctech2011.txt and bctech2012.txt. this is kind of an example of extracted texts.

Data Analysis: 
Each of the extracted texts from the article, i've performed textual analysis and computed the variables, given in the output structure excel file. 
NOTE: USED PYTHON PROGRAMMING FOR THE DATA ANALYSIS.

Look for these variables in the analysis: 
1. POSITIVE SCORE
2. NEGATIVE SCORE
3. POLARITY SCORE
4. SUBJECTIVITY SCORE
5. AVG SENTENCE LENGTH
6. PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS
7. FOG INDEX
8. AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE
9. COMPLEX WORD COUNT
10. WORD COUNT
11. SYLLABLE PER WORD
12. PERSONAL PRONOUNS
13. AVG WORD LENGTH
